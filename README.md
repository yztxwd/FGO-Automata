## Install

Required libs: *ADB*, *PIL*, *OpenCV*,  *numpy* and *pytesseract*

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Meowcolm024/FGO-Automata.git`
2. Install *ADB*:
   - macOS: `brew cask install android-platform-tools`
   - Windows: `choco install adb`
3. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install *Tesseract* (Required by `pytesseract`)
   - macOS: `brew install tesseract`
   - Windows: Click [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki#windows)

## Setup

There are mainly 4 ways to set up *FGO-Automata*(as automation script):

- If you are familiar with _Python_, you can try to manually write the scipt. (See: [References](#references)) (You can also checkout the [example.py](example.py))
- If you are using _Windows_, double click `config.bat` to set up the script.（中文）
- If you are using _macOS_(or _Linux_), run `daemon.py` to set up the script.
- You can also use the *FGO-Automata Script* (See: [FGO-Automata Script](#fgo-automata-script))

You can also use *FGO-Automata* as an API in your own project, just import the package :)

## Notice

When using FGO-Automata as a automation script, notice the following things:

1. Turn **OFF** skill confirmation(*Quick Cast*).
2. When using `config.bat` or `demon.py`, make sure you can pass the Checkpoint within **3 turns**.
3. Recommended: turn ON *Speed Up Death Animation* and *2x Speed*
4. **Resolution requirement: 1920x1080(recommended), or other 1080p screens (`shifts` setting required)**

## FGO-Automata Script

### Usage

- Start REPL: `python REPL.py` (Interactive environment)
- Run `FGO-Automata Script`: `python REPL.py [script file]`

### Cheatsheet

<details>

``` python
# comments start with '#'

sft=(248,0) # set shifts

ckp="assets/Qp4.png" # reset checkpoint
spt="assets/eg-sp1.png" # reset support

start # quick start

s7 # select servant skill 7
s5t1 # select servant skill 5 target 1

m1 # select master skill 1
m2t3 # select master skill 2 target 3
m3o1t2 # select Order Change: change servant 1 for servant 2

c2 # select card 2
c65 # select card 6, 5

finish # finish battle

show # show current setting
```

</details>

## References

### 1. Initialization

#### 1. Import package

```python
from core.Automata import Automata
```

- First import the package

#### 2. Setup the Class

```python
rin = Automata("assets/checkpoint.png", "assets/qp.png")
shiki = Automata("assets/checkpoint.png", "assets/qp.png", sft=(248, 0))
ryougi = Automata("assets/checkpoint.png", "assets/qp.png", sft=(248, 0), apl=(1, "assets/silver.png"))
```

- The first argument and the second one refers to the **path** of your **template** of checkpoint and **support servant**.
- For the *optional* param `sft`: if you screen resolution is *1920x1080*, just ignore it. But if there are blues straps at the edges, it is the shift of the top left corner. For `(x, y)`, *x* refers to the shifts in x-axis shift, *y* refers to y-axis shift.
- For the *optional* param `apl`: it is a tuple of `(int, str)`, the first item is number, representing how many apples will be consumed. The second one refers to the **path** of your **template** of the type of the apple (incl. *Quartz*). **(It has the same function as `set_apples`)**

#### 3. AP related (Optional)

```python
# .set_apples(<number of the apples>, <path to the apples>)
shiki.set_apples(0, "assets/silver.png")
```

- **NOTICE: It will override the set apples and the counter**
- If you are using it as a automation bot, you may encounter AP problem which need to use *Gold Apples*.
- Notice that the function recieves 2 arguments. The first item is number, representing how many apples will be consumed. The second one refers to the **path** of your **template** of the type of the apple (incl. *Quartz*).

### 2. Start battle

#### 1. Quick Start (Recommended)

```python
# .quick_start(advance=True)
shiki.quick_start()
```

- If you don't need to modify your checkpoints and supports you can use this. (Then you can skip the following 4 articles)
- By default, this method will use the `Advance Support Selection`(See [Advance Support Selection](#4-use-advance-support-selection-optional)). But you can also turn it OFF, which use the old way, by setting `advance=False`.

#### 2. Reset Checkpoint (Optional)

```python
shiki.select_checkpoint("assets/checkpoint2.png") # the argument is optional
```

- This method is implemented in `.quick_start()` without the argument.
- You can reset checkpoint image if needed.

#### 3. Reset Support (DEPRECATED)

```python
# start
shiki.select_support("assets/qp2.png") # the argument is optional
```

- **NOTICE: The function of this method is replaced by `Advance Support Selection`**
- This method is implemented in `.quick_start()` without the argument.
- You can reset support image if needed.

> **About support selection**  
> It will onlt select the *support servant* in first page(the first 3 servants) if there isn't any match, it will automatically select the **first** support servant by default

#### 4. Use Advance Support Selection (Optional)

```python
rin.advance_support()  # w/o any param
ryougi.advance_support(tms=5)  # update time only
shiki.advance_support(spt="assets/sp3.png", tms=1)
```

- This is the advance support selection, it will check the first 3 support, if none matches, it will scroll down to have another check. If there is still isn't any matches, it will try to update the support list, then repeat the cycle.
- The argument `spt` is optional, you can override the original support servant.
- The argument `tms` is the times the script will update the support list, default is `3`.

#### 5. Start Battle (Optional)

```python
shiki.start_battle()
```

- If you did **NOT** use `.quick_start()`, you need to use this command to start the battle.

### 3. During battle

#### 1. Select cards

```python
# .select_cards(<list of the desired cards(in order)>)
shiki.select_cards([7])
rin.select_cards([8,6])
ryougi.select_cards([1,2,3])
```

- Notice this function receives a *list* of maximum **3** numbers. If the list is empty or has less numbers, more cards from normal cards will be selected randomly.
- For the numbers' meaning: Number **1~5** refer to the *normal cards* from **left** to **right**. Number **6,7,8** refer to *NP cards*.
- Cards will be taped in orders

#### 2. Select Servant skills

```python
# skill w/o target
# .select_servant_skill(<id of the skill>)
shiki.select_servant_skill(4)
```

- Notice this function receives a number.
- The number can be in the range of **1~9**, each refers to the skill counted from left.

```python
# with target Servant
# select_servant_skill(<id of the skill>, <id of the target servant>)
ryougi.select_servant_skill(2, 3)
```

- You can also add the second argument for the target *Servant*(See: [*Select Servants*](#4-select-servant)). The second argument receives a number. The number can be in the range of **1~3**, each refers to the *Servant* counted from left.

#### 3. Select Master skills

```python
# skill w/o target
# .select_master_skill(<id of the skill>)
shiki.select_master_skill(2)
```

- Notice this function receives a number.
- The number can be in the range of **1~3**, each refers to the skill counted from left.

```python
# with target Servant
# .select_master_skill(<id of the skill>, <id of the target servant>)
ryougi.select_master_skill(1, 3)
```

- You can also add the second argument for target *Servant*(See: [*Select Servants*](#4-select-servant)). The second argument receives a number. The number can be in the range of **1~3**, each refers to the *Servant* counted from left.

```python
# Order Change
# .select_master_skill(<id of the skill>, <id of the first servant>, <id of the second servant>)
rin.select_master_skill(3, 1, 1)
```

- If the skill is *Order Change*, you can add the third argument(See: [*Change Servants*](#5-change-servants)). In the second and third argument, each should be a number in the range of **1~3**. The second arg refers to the first 3 Servants and the third one refers to the last 3.

#### 4. Select Servant

```python
# .select_servant(<id of the skill>)
shiki.select_servant(1)
```

- **NOTICE: This function has been integrated to `select_servant_skill` and `select_master_skill`, so you don't need to use it explicitly. (Besides, the reference below is still vaild.)**
- There are some skills in *FGO* have target servant, if the skill you have chosen is this kind of skill, you may need to use this function to choose the desired *Servant*.
- Notice this function receives a number.
- The number can be in the range of **1~3**, each refers to the *Servant* counted from left.

#### 5. Change Servants

```python
# .change_servant(<id of the first servant>, <id of the second servant>)
shiki.change_servant(1, 1)
```

- **NOTICE: This function has been integrated to `select_master_skill`, so you don't need to use it explicitly. (Besides, the reference below is still vaild.)**
- This function receives 2 numbers, each should be in the range of **1~3**.
- The first arg refers to the first 3 Servants and the second one refers to the last 3.

### 4. Finish battle

```python
# finish
shiki.finish_battle()
```

- This function allows the program tap through the ending of battle.

### 5. Other functions

#### 1. Wait for a certain scene

```python
shiki.wait("assets/checkpoint.png")
```

- It allows you idle the script till a certain scene
- It receives an argument of the *path* of the template image.

#### 2. Tap screen

```python
shiki.tap((100, 100), 0, 0)
```

- Allows to tap a certain point in the screen
- The first arg is a tuple of the coordinate `(x, y)`
- The 2nd and the 3rd args are random shifts in x and y, if you don't want have any shifts, replace with `0`

#### 3. Toggle Master Skill

```python
shiki.toggle_master_skill()
```

- You can use this function to turn on/off the _Master_ skill panel.

#### 4. Update Support List

```python
# .update_support() -> bool
x = shiki.update_support()
```

- It returns `True` if the *support list* is successfully updated, otherwise is `False`.

#### 5. Battle ID related

```python
# .get_current_battle -> int
x = shiki.get_current_battle()

- Returns `True` if reached else `False`

### 6. Auto Battle

```python
# use_dynamica(target)
shiki.use_dynamica(2)
```

- The param `target` is the target battle id.
- It allows the script to run fully automatically (See: [FGO-One](https://github.com/Meowcolm024/FGO-One) for the basic idea and how it works)
- Do notice that `tesseract` **fails frequently**

> The `Dynamica` will ignore *Brave Chain*, *NP Cards* and *Skills*

### 7. Reset Ckp/Spt/Sft

``` python
shiki.reset_checkpoint("assets/Qp4.png")
shiki.reset_support("assets/eg-sp1.png")
shiki.reset_shifts((0, 0))
```

- You can reset checkpoint/support/shift using these functions

### 8. Get screenshot

``` python
# .aquire_screenshot() -> str:
shiki.aquire_screenshot()
```

- Take a screenshot on the device and returns the path of the image.

## Making Templates

Here are two examples of the template:

<details>

![checkpoint](assets/eg-ckp.png)
![another checkpoint](assets/Training4.png)

- These are templates of _checkpoints_

![support](assets/eg-sp2.png)
![another support](assets/eg-sp3.png)

- These are templates of _supports_

</details>

> The template image of the support can either be an image of a *Craft Essence* or a *Servant*(You don't need to precisely cut the image like above.).  
> You can use the *filter feature* in the game to filter the crafts and use an image of a desired *Servant* for selection.

**Notice that your template should be distinctive.**
